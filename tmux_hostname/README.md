This codes are taken from `https://github.com/soyuka/tmux-current-pane-hostname/tree/master/scripts`.
Lessons learned are
* Don't use Nord-tmux. Its colors are different from vim-tmuxline and it looks ugly/broken.
* The solution is to use vim-tmuxline but with custom hostname that can be fetched with these scripts.
(* And for simplicity I should not use tmuxline integrated in vim-airline or nord integrated in vim-airline)
